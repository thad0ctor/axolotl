# Multimodal assistant-only loss masking

## What this fixes

For multimodal fine-tuning, `cfg.train_on_inputs`, `cfg.roles_to_train`, and
`cfg.train_on_eos` were silently ignored. Every non-pad, non-media token in
the sequence — including system prompts, user turns, and role markers —
contributed to the loss. Only Gemma3n had a working per-role mask; every
other multimodal path (LLaVA, Qwen2-VL, Qwen3.5, Gemma3, Llama-3.2 Vision,
Llama 4, Pixtral, Mistral V7 Tekken, Voxtral, SmolVLM2, Mistral3, InternVL,
GLM4V) trained on the full sequence.

## Root cause

`MultiModalChatDataCollator` re-tokenizes raw `messages` via
`processor.apply_chat_template(...)` at collation time, discarding the
per-role labels already computed by `ChatTemplateStrategy.tokenize_prompt` in
the preprocessing path. It then calls
`processing_strategy.process_labels(input_ids)`, which was supposed to rebuild
role-aware labels — but the base `_mask_non_assistant` was a no-op `return
labels`, and only `Gemma3nProcessingStrategy` overrode it. So for every other
multimodal model, the retokenized labels are never masked by role.

Parallel bug ([#3617](https://github.com/axolotl-ai-cloud/axolotl/issues/3617)):
`cfg.processor_kwargs` was never plumbed through to
`processor_cls.from_pretrained`, so users couldn't pass `min_pixels`,
`max_pixels`, `num_crops`, etc., to VLM processors.

## Design

We make role masking a first-class, declarative capability of the base
`ProcessingStrategy` and thread the masking knobs through from the trainer
builder.

### Why this over alternatives

- **Option (b): preserve the per-role labels from `tokenize_prompt`.**
  Rejected. The preprocessing labels were computed against a text-only
  tokenization; they don't align with the MM collator's re-tokenization after
  image/audio/video placeholders expand into hundreds of placeholder tokens.
  Preserving them would require either a second tokenization pass with image
  stand-ins, or rewriting the collator to never re-tokenize. Either is
  high-blast-radius for an incremental bugfix.
- **Option (c): `apply_chat_template(return_assistant_tokens_mask=True)`.**
  Rejected. This requires `{% generation %}` / `{% endgeneration %}` jinja
  markers. Only `llava.jinja` and `phi_4.jinja` have them in
  `src/axolotl/utils/chat_templates/templates/`. Adding these markers to
  upstream-mirrored templates (gemma3, qwen2_vl, llama3_2_vision, etc.)
  diverges from the reference templates and is fragile when HF updates them.
- **Option (a): parametrized token-boundary scanner in the base class.**
  Chosen. Each strategy declares its per-role boundary markers
  (`<|im_start|>assistant\n` ... `<|im_end|>` for Qwen2-VL,
  `<|turn>model` ... `<turn|>` for Gemma 4, etc.). The base scanner walks the
  re-tokenized sequence, locates role spans, and masks everything outside
  `cfg.roles_to_train`. Works with existing jinja templates, is testable
  offline with fake tokenizers, and fails visible (unverified strategies emit
  a one-shot warning rather than silently mis-masking).

### Components

1. **`RoleBoundary`** dataclass in `src/axolotl/processing_strategies.py`
   describing one role's `(start_tokens, end_tokens, include_start, include_end)`.
2. **`_apply_role_boundaries`** function: a longest-prefix-match scanner that
   implements `roles_to_train` / `train_on_inputs` / `train_on_eos` (`"turn"`
   keeps role-end markers on trainable turns, `"all"` keeps them on every
   turn, `"none"` excludes them).
3. **`ProcessingStrategy._build_role_boundaries`**: empty by default;
   overridden by each subclass. `_mask_non_assistant` delegates to the
   scanner; if no boundaries are declared it short-circuits and emits a
   one-shot warning (legacy behavior preserved).
4. **Plumbing**: `cfg.train_on_inputs`, the first dataset's `roles_to_train`
   and `train_on_eos` are threaded through `build_collator` →
   `get_processing_strategy` → each strategy's constructor.
5. **`cfg.processor_kwargs`** added to `ModelInputConfig` and merged into
   kwargs passed to `processor_cls.from_pretrained` in `load_processor`.
   Axolotl-managed keys (`revision`, `trust_remote_code`) are filtered out
   with a warning if the user tries to override them.

¹ Pixtral and Mistral V7 Tekken share a token (`[/INST]`) between the
user-end and assistant-start markers. The scanner consumes the first
occurrence when terminating the user span; the immediate assistant-start
that follows is therefore skipped unless the user removes the user boundary
from `roles_to_train` explicitly. This limitation is documented in a
tombstone test; users who need stricter assistant masking on these templates
should swap to the `pixtral`/`mistral_v7_tekken` template-type-specific
subclass we ship and open an issue for the shared-marker case.

*unverified*: the right boundary markers cannot be confirmed without a real
checkpoint; the fallback preserves the legacy "mask pad + media tokens only"
behavior and emits a one-shot warning naming the strategy class so the miss
is visible in training logs. To enable role masking for one of these models,
subclass the strategy and implement `_build_role_boundaries` — see the Gemma
and Qwen implementations for the pattern.

## Config-based override: `cfg.role_boundaries`

For the "unverified" strategies above, or for custom chat templates that
don't match a built-in strategy's markers, users can declare role boundaries
directly in YAML without subclassing:

```yaml
role_boundaries:
  - role: assistant
    start: "<|turn>model"
    end: "<turn|>"
  - role: user
    start: "<|turn>user"
    end: "<turn|>"
  # Optional keys:
  # include_start: false   # default False
  # include_end: true      # default True, respects cfg.train_on_eos
  # end: eos_token         # sentinel: resolves to tokenizer.eos_token_id
  # end: null              # span runs to end of sequence
```

Semantics:

- `start` and `end` are literal strings; axolotl encodes them at strategy
  init via `tokenizer.encode(..., add_special_tokens=False)` and logs the
  resolved token-id sequences at INFO level.
- The special value `end: eos_token` is the portable way to express
  "Pixtral-style assistant turns end at EOS" without hard-coding an id.
- When `role_boundaries` is set, it **replaces** the strategy's built-in
  declarations wholesale. This is intentional: partial overlays are hard to
  reason about at review time.
- `cfg.roles_to_train` still governs which declared roles contribute to
  loss. You can declare `user` and `assistant` boundaries and set
  `roles_to_train: ["assistant"]` to have the scanner correctly identify
  user spans as masking boundaries without training on their content.
- Invalid specs fail loudly at strategy init (missing `role`/`start`,
  unencodable markers), not silently at loss-compute time.

## Commits on this branch

1. **`feat: systemic multimodal assistant-only loss masking`** — core
   refactor of `processing_strategies.py` (`RoleBoundary`,
   `_apply_role_boundaries`, `_build_role_boundaries`), per-strategy boundary
   declarations, dispatcher routing for new subclasses.
2. **`feat: thread cfg.train_on_inputs / roles_to_train / train_on_eos into
   MM collator`** — `build_collator` reads the knobs from `cfg` and the
   first dataset entry and passes them to `get_processing_strategy`.
3. **`feat: forward cfg.processor_kwargs to processor from_pretrained (#3617)`**
   — schema field added; `load_processor` merges kwargs; axolotl-managed
   keys (`revision`, `trust_remote_code`) protected.
4. **`test: offline unit tests for multimodal role-mask scanner and
   processor_kwargs plumbing`** — 32 tests covering scanner semantics,
   per-strategy masking, media-token masking within assistant spans,
   dispatcher routing, and the processor_kwargs passthrough.
5. **`docs: multimodal assistant-mask design doc`** — this file.
6. **`feat: cfg.role_boundaries YAML override for role-mask scanner`** —
   schema field (`MultiModalConfig.role_boundaries`), resolver that converts
   string markers to token ids at strategy init, ``eos_token`` sentinel, and
   wiring through ``build_collator`` / ``get_processing_strategy`` /
   every strategy constructor. 7 additional offline unit tests covering
   override semantics (replace built-in, enable on unverified strategy,
   eos_token sentinel, null end, validation errors, pydantic model input).

(Final packaging: these were squashed into logical units during implementation
but the branch commit sequence can be organized per reviewer preference.)

## Verification

- All 32 unit tests pass offline (`pytest tests/test_processing_strategies.py`).
- End-to-end check against real tokenizers:
  - `google/gemma-4-E2B-it`: 13/40 tokens kept for a 2-turn chat; decoded
    preview shows only assistant responses + `<turn|>` markers remain.
  - `axolotl-ai-co/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-tokenizer` (with bundled
    `llama3_2_vision.jinja`): 11/64 tokens kept; content correctly resolves
    to `"The capital of France is Paris.<|eot_id|>"` and `"Berlin.<|eot_id|>"`.
- Verified boundary token ids against the real Gemma 4 tokenizer:
  `<|turn>model` → `[105, 4368]`, `<turn|>` → `[106]`, `<|image|>` → `258880`,
  `<|audio|>` → `258881`, `<|video|>` → `258884`.
